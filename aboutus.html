         </div>   
         <div class="p1">
            <p>Awarded as Emerging Cafe Chain Of The Year by Franchise India, Food Castle– The Ristorante Lounge is a thriving success with over 21 outlets across the country. Today, FC has become a hot spot for today’s youth with our innovative ideas and conceptual spaces, each outlet reflecting distinctive personalities and vibes to amalgamate with people of the area, becoming close to the heart of every millennial.</p>
            <p>Our mantra, “Unculture Yourself”, a message we unravel with every new revolution and concept. We dare to help our customers encounter a new experience, every time they visit us.</p>
            <p>We began our journey in 2004 with the launch of our first flagship store in New York City,  America. Since then we are growing exponentially year by year and by the end of 2021, we plan to launch a total of 100 outlets across the country.</p>

            <h3>OUR SPACES</h3>
            <p>We are focused on giving a satisfactory user experience and creating spaces which connect with the local culture of any location we establish at. As a brand, we deeply understand and value the connect our customers need to feel and thus, each of our cafes are community spaces, socializing spots that are inspired by the localism of the area.</p>

            <h3>THE MENU</h3>
            <p>Fresh & superior quality ingredients are used to create innovative dishes and beverages that taste & look distinctive and incite fascination. The coffees are famous, but CC is equally known for its vast range of food items & their presentations. From serving the burgers in a treasure box to sizzlers in a wooden ship, from fishbowl martinis to the introduction of unique Insta Specials, we have always pushed the limits in everything we do unculturing ourselves and ones who visit us.</p>
         
            <h3>THE AMBIENCE</h3>
            <p>We are constantly focused on creating a space that every customer feels welcome to. With each outlet, we ensure to design an ambiance that not only resonates with the people of that area, it also makes the branch one of a kind. From the lighting to the curated music, from free-walk spaces to the seating, we formulate an aesthetic as a whole so the final picture at the end is nothing short of marvelous!</p>
